### 🚀 about

This repository shares some of my demos/prototypes that I built for various occasions. Please use this code carefully since these are just demos and not production ready systems.

#### 📁 repo structure

Each folder in this repository contains a standalone demo/prototype and is self-contained. The only exception to this is the `_miscellaneous_small_demos folder`. Please refer to the individual Readme.md files within the folders for further information.
