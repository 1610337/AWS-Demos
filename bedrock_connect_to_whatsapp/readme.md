## About this repository:
Let Amazon Bedrock respond to your WhatsApp messages! This repository contains basic node.js code that connects to your WhatsApp Web Account via a QR Code that you need to scan. It then reacts to every message that you receive using the prompt written in code.

## How to start this code?
node main.js

## To Do
This is WIP. It'd be good to make LLM aware of the chat history and play around with the prompt that was used. There are probably some node.js specific styling issues as well that you begging to be fixed :) 

#### Thanks
Special thanks to https://wwebjs.dev/. The integration into WhatsApp Web is really smooth!
